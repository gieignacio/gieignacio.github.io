	<h2 style="padding-top:50px;padding-bottom:0px;">“Local Kiddos”</h2>
	<p style="padding-bottom:50px;">
	Nervous yet determined. It was a very fine day to get along with the Mangyans for they already show their gratitude on having us on their community. Thanks to that immense immersion we have, the school had given a guaranteed outlet of total exploration and discovery, for such an aptitude that we can exercise within the over-the-sea engagement activity. Back to that time, I see such young, innocent faces of Hanunuo tribe that completes the entire social structure of Brgy. Emok, well for all usual community too.
	Searching for her camera application on the surface of her flattened, hard piece of modernity that seems weird for the local kiddos on our front,  my colleague, Jennefer, keeps on tapping on her Ipod to fulfill her duty of taking such precious photos on our trip. But it was different on this time, we should be careful of getting our things done on this indigenous people. They don’t accept the full presence of novelty, they still on the spot of safe living like old as time, as what I think. On such a snap, I’ve seen her giving some of her snacks on these small, poor faces but not conceal the nature of literated  behavior, a simple satisfaction. Comparing to that bragging brothers or sisters of yours who wants to get something from you in a very instant, there’s an alteration from these youngsters that they can only get what others offer from them, a sign of true connection and creed of Mangyans.

	<h2 style="padding-top:50px;padding-bottom:0px;">“Progenies behind that Carabao”</h2>
	<p style="padding-bottom:50px;">
	“Survival of the fittest” the distinctive quote for all human beings. First catch: a game, deep one: a mayhem. Wars, debates, racism, corruption, are the undying root words of it. Well that is the reality, an actual eye-soring truth. Humans are on the highest seat of creation, and greediness. This two kids on the portrait is the foremost example. 
	Crybaby, childish children since birth. Small legs with pitiful skins. The three of us feel the necessity of these kids to ride behind that carabao for a meters away buko farm. We’re not demanding, it’s just that there’s something makes me realize. A quite perspective indeed, that the journey of human race was depended on the nature’s bounty, widely participated by animals. The sad thing is that humanity is a disease-a dramatic living in a selfish way.

	<h2 style="padding-top:50px;padding-bottom:0px;">“Guest’s buko walk”</h2>
	<p style="padding-bottom:50px;">
	Eagerness, willingness and experience, that’s what makes him push to do it. We don’t oppose yet we don’t let him. It’s just that we believe he will try. For some, “curiosity kills the cat” but in this case, it’s a matter of interest within the explicit piece of visual info that would surely suffice his curiosity to carry a two buko on his front and back.
	“You’re good Mel” one of my classmate had burst out when we’ve seen him opening a fresh harvest buko that Manong gave us. Through his bolo, he makes us see the sweet inside of the fruit. Morning sunrays was now hurting our skins so the humble family that we join on the activity was decided to leave for good. Then again, he help them by carrying the improvised sticks with two buko that was already comfy to handle about. It was 100 meters to walk and we don’t mind it. We’re ready for the kind of experience on that situation, minding that we will forever cherish this in our life. But in the case of Mel, we surely don’t know. We admit, he’s enjoying what he’s doing but to his little veins, I don’t think so.

	<h2 style="padding-top:50px;padding-bottom:0px;">“Handstand, hands-down”</h2>
	<p style="padding-bottom:50px;">
 	Swim, jump and splash. Most of us, the young ones had gone frenzy on swimming on that beautiful stream like a child. Some are playing muddy structure on the sand while some are taking pictures to capture their appearances with those well-made rock formations that seems the nature were driven to create it. While we seize the moment, this kid was too good to try his handstand and voila! he did it. That was very amazing to see and also, Jennefer was indeed a good photographer again as she able to capture this talent of a Mangyan teen.
The journey to that mini-beach had sum up our full experience in our immersion. For three consecutive days, we’re surely treasure this for a lifetime. The warm welcome they have shown us on our arrival, until at this very moment on the lake, we truly appreciate their efforts to makes us see what they feel, hear and touch. The smooth property of the gray sand had reflected on their renowned behavior towards themselves and on us.

	<p style="padding-bottom:50px;">
	
	Still on the buko hunt game. Together with the broods of the family that let us join the trip, we will surely get something amazing out of them. And it’s a quite a  good thought that we are lucky enough to witness how good the patriarchs to finish a job on the farm. At the same time, it should have a little mix of spending our convenience on watching the scene, for it will supply by the adorability of those children who are irritated to stay in just one spot like we used to.
	Here comes a fashionable clothed Mangyan kid. Unlike those of her fellow peeps, she’s quite and cute. Unfortunately, I didn’t get her name but that face and the way she acts her body on the space, she’s already recognizable on my mind. She got her mom on her back, with strap of cloth around its body that covers her young brother. She’s peacefully watching her father climbing so incredibly on the body of coconut trees to reach the top and get those fruits. Her eyes are firmly tracing each act as it can pain her neck. She’s also feeling the same way we have when we definitely watching the old man too. That scene of appreciation was a total definition of our immersion, to watch and learn.
